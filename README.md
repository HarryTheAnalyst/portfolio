 USA Used Car Sales Analysis and Visualization
Background
This project leverages a comprehensive dataset of used car sales in the USA (sourced from Kaggle) to provide actionable insights for individuals or businesses entering the automobile sales industry.

Recommendations
As a Mechanical Engineer with experience in motor vehicle sales, I recommend the following for aspiring used car dealers in the USA:

Stock Quality Vehicles: Focus on “buy-and-drive” cars requiring minimal repairs.
Geographic Strategy: Target high-demand states like California, Texas, and Florida.
Optimized Pricing: Strategically price vehicles above market value to maximize profits.
Brand Focus: Prioritize luxury, performance, and comfort-oriented models.
Seasonal Inventory Planning: Increase stock in Q1 and Q4 while minimizing inventory in Q2.
Color Preferences: Opt for vehicles with silver, white, or black exteriors and dark, gray, or beige interiors, aligning with customer preferences.
