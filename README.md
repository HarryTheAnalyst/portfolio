Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Sales Performance Overview

1.Total Sales Volume: Tracks the total number of vehicles sold over specific periods.

2.Average Selling Price (ASP): Analyzes the average selling price of vehicles.

3.Sales by Condition: Examines vehicle sales based on condition (good, fair, poor).

4.Sales by Geography (State): Identifies regional sales trends across states.

In-Depth Insights

1.Age of Vehicle: Measures the difference between the year of manufacture and the sale year.

2.Price-to-Market Ratio: Compares selling prices to market values.

3.Sales by Make and Model: Highlights popular brands and models.

4.Mileage Impact on Selling Price: Explores how mileage influences pricing and demand.

5.Customer Segment Analysis by Vehicle Attributes: Studies consumer preferences for features such as color, trim, and body style.

Key Insights

1.Condition Matters: Vehicles in good condition dominate sales, while those in poor condition perform poorly.

2.Regional Demand:

oCalifornia, Texas, and Florida are the top states for used car sales, with California leading at $917.79M.

oAlabama had the lowest sales at $0.24M.

3.Price-to-Market Analysis:

o50.8% of vehicles sold above market price, 46.8% below, and 2.4% at market price.

oNearly half of all sales below market price reduced profit margins.

4.Luxury Brands Dominate: Luxury and performance-oriented brands (e.g., Rolls-Royce) were most in demand, with Rolls-Royce achieving the highest average sales of $153.89K.

5.Seasonal Trends:

oHighest sales volumes occurred in February ($1.47B).

oLowest sales occurred in April ($11.07M).

6.Mileage and Price Correlation: Lower mileage generally correlates with higher prices. However, brand and other features can override this trend.

Recommendations

1.Stock Quality Vehicles: Prioritize vehicles in excellent condition that require minimal repairs ("buy and drive" units).

2.Focus on High-Demand Regions: Concentrate marketing efforts in California, Texas, and Florida due to strong demand.

3.Optimize Pricing Strategies: Aim to sell vehicles above market price where possible to maximize profit margins.

4.Prioritize Luxury and Performance Models: Stock brands and models that emphasize performance, luxury, and comfort.

5.Seasonal Stocking Strategies:

oIncrease inventory in the first and last quarters of the year to meet high demand.

oMinimize stock during the second quarter, when sales typically dip.

6.Tailor Inventory to Customer Preferences: Focus on dark, gray, and beige interiors, as well as silver, white, and black exteriors, which remain consistently popular.
